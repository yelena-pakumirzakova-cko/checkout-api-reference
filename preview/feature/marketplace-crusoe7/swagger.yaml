    # Introduction
    
    Checkout.com provides a collection of APIs that enable you to process and manage payments.  
    
    Our APIs accept and return JSON in the HTTP body and return HTTP response codes to indicate errors. You can consume the APIs directly using your favorite HTTP/REST library or make use of one of our <a href="https://docs.checkout.com/docs/sdks" target="_blank">SDKs</a>.  
    

    Our unified payments API allows you to accept payments from cards, digital wallets and the most popular alternative payment methods, as well as pay out to a variety of destinations, all using the same integration. 
    
    
    And with our webhook management, events and disputes APIs, you can keep on top of your transactions and react to any chargebacks, keeping your business running smoothly. 
    
    # Authentication
    
    When you sign up for an account, you are given a secret and public API key pair for API key authentication, or an access key ID and secret for OAuth 2.0.  
    You authenticate with our API by following the appropriate authentication flow, using either your API keys or your access key credentials.  
    

    Never share your secret keys or access key credentials. Keep them guarded and secure.

                This 8-digit token should be generated by a merchant. When a subsequent payment
                is initialized with the same card token, a customer is presented with two options.
                The customer can choose to pay with KFast (doesn't need to enter card details again),
                or with KNet as usual. The payment flow stays the same i.e. a merchant should redirect
                a customer to the redirect URL which is provided in the payment creation response.
                Note that `user_defined_field3` must be omitted when the `card_token` field is not empty. This restriction
                exists because a card token is passed to KNet Gateway as user defined field 3

      description: >
            Unless explicitly stated, all endpoints require authentication using your secret key. 
            Public keys should only be used in JavaScript or native applications. 
      
            You can find your API keys, and generate new ones, in your <a href="https://hub.checkout.com/login" target="blank">Hub account</a>.

    OAuth:
      type: oauth2
      description: |
        For server-to-server communication, we support the OAuth 2.0 client credentials flow.
        We will provide you with a set of access key credentials – an access key ID and secret – which you can exchange for an access token by calling the 'request an access token' endpoint below. 
        You will need to authenticate using basic authentication, using your access key ID and access key secret as your username and password:
      
        ```
        curl --location --request POST 'https://access.checkout.com/connect/token' \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
        --header 'Authorization: Basic dGVzdC1hY2Nlc3Mta2V5LWlkOnRlc3QtYWNjZXNzLWtleS1zZWNyZXQ=' \
        --data-urlencode 'grant_type=client_credentials' \
        --data-urlencode 'scope=gateway'
        ```
      
        The token server will return a Bearer `access_token` in JSON Web Token (JWT) format which you should use in the `Authorization`
        header of your API requests:
      
        ```
        curl --location --request POST 'https://api.checkout.com/payments' \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --header 'Accept: application/json' \
        --header 'Authorization: Bearer {{AccessToken}}' \
        --data-raw '{
          "amount": 10000,
          "currency": "USD",
          "reference": "Visa-USD-Test",
          ...
        }'
        ```
      
        Your access token will be valid for a length of time (in seconds) indicated by the `expires_in` field in the response. When it expires, you'll need to either request a new one. You can use one of our SDKs to handle this automatically.
      
        Depending on the Environment against which you're making your requests against you'll need to request the token from a different Authorization Server.
